# 36cube
Over-engineered solution to the 36 Cube Puzzle written in the V language.

I thought I'd try out a new language when trying to solve the 36 Cube Puzzle. It could be programmed more simply and efficiently, but I was trying to use many mechanics of the V language to learn the language.

Turns out this puzzle is quite tricky, but once you are aware of its nuances it can be solved programmatically. This program outputs all 96 possible solutions.
